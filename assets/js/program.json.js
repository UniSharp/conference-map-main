            "abstract": "<p>Taiwan has officially kicked off its open data initiative in late 2012, \nand government departments have begun to release its data since Q2, \n2013. This initiative builds upon an existing Act of “Open Government \nInformation” enacted years ago. Each government Ministry is required to\n identify a minimum of 5 data categories in the first trial phase (Mar. \n2013), and 50 categories in the second phase, which ends in Dec. 2013.<br />\nThrough this initiative, it is hoped that the government may achieve a \nlevel of improved transparency in its operation, and more importantly \nstimulate creativities from the private sector in applying these open \ndatasets. A matching subsidizing program has also been established in \naiding the private sector to develop creative applications that either \npromote the convenience of citizens’ daily life, or create business \nvalues which could yield economic gains for the society as a whole. In \nall, this open data initiative would not only put Taiwan neck-to-neck \nwith other countries of early movers, but also establish Taiwan as a \nglobal milestone in stimulating good applications from the private \nsector.</p>\n",
